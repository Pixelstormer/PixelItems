# Pixel's Assorted Interactables
This is a mod for tModLoader. Keep in mind it is being developed moreso for the fun and experience of developing it, rather than to provide a particularly polished and well-balanced helping of content.

`PixelItems` is the internal name of the mod, and the name of this repository, while *Pixel's Assorted Interactables* is the display name.  
Given the verbosity of the display name, `PixelItems`, `Pixel's Items`, or some other permutation of the internal name may be used as a shorthand.
